# 🧩 Project Contribution Log

This file documents weekly progress and individual contributions made by all team members throughout the Mobile App Development with Flutter internship project.

## 🗓️ Week 1 — Project Setup & Planning
**Focus:** Defining app concept, preparing documentation, and designing core wireframes.

- **Mainuddin:** Created and structured the initial `README.md` file. Defined the project vision, objectives, and navigation flow for the Learn-E app.  
- **Isiri:** Designed low-fidelity wireframes for key app screens (Login, Home, Program Listing, Program Details) using Figma. Ensured consistent layout and color theme across screens.  
- **Abrar:** Drafted the App Proposal and compiled the Week 1 Deliverable Document combining all required components (proposal, wireframes, and GitHub link).  
- **Saba:** Coordinated communication between members, ensuring all components were aligned and submitted together on time.

## 🗓️ Week 2 — Core UI Development
**Focus:** Building the app’s core screens, implementing navigation, and improving structure.

- **Mainuddin:** Developed the `signup_screen.dart` and `login_screen.dart` with input fields, form layout, and responsive design. Worked on navigation logic for the authentication flow.  
- **Isiri:** Designed and implemented the Program Listing, Program Details, Profile, and Settings screens. Integrated navigation between pages and contributed to the Week 2 Deliverable Document.  
- **Abrar:** Developed the Home, Profile, About, and Settings pages, refined navigation routes, merged contributions from other members, and added content sections to enhance the app experience.  
- **Saba:** Updated and improved the `README.md` file with new screenshots, Figma links, and clear setup instructions for the app.

## 🗓️ Week 3 — Data Integration & Validation
**Focus:** Connecting backend (MockAPI), implementing form validation, and improving data management.

- **Mainuddin:** Implemented complete validation for the Signup (Register) form, including date-of-birth picker and error handling for empty or invalid inputs.  
- **Isiri:** Connected the MockAPI service to the Program Listing and Home screens. Wrote functions to fetch and display data dynamically from the MockAPI.  
- **Abrar:** Fixed UI inconsistencies across multiple pages, improved widget alignment, and standardized colors and fonts for a smoother user experience.  
- **Saba:** Converted hard-coded data into JSON format, structured a `program_data.json` file, and created a MockAPI endpoint to simulate real data integration.
